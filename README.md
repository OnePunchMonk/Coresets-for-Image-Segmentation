## Project: Coreset Implementation and Evaluation

This project aims to implement coresets and assess their effectiveness in the context of image segmentation. Coresets are compact summaries of a larger dataset that can be used to approximate the results of algorithms on the original data while significantly reducing computational costs.

## Files

skeletoncode.py: Contains code for foundational tasks related to coreset construction (specify tasks briefly).
uniform_sampling1.py: Implements a baseline approach, potentially uniform random sampling, for comparison (specify functionality).
image segmentation task.py: Contains the core implementation of image segmentation using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).
whatsapp vid: Video demonstration of the KNN segmentation code running with coresets.
## Dependencies

List any necessary libraries or software required to run the code, along with their installation instructions. Common libraries for coresets and image processing might include scikit-learn and OpenCV.

## Running the Codes

Coreset Construction:

Explain how to run skeletoncode.py and uniform_sampling1.py to create different coresets (e.g., command line arguments for specifying coreset size).
Note that the video for these tasks might be attached to GC (provide instructions on accessing it if possible).
Image Segmentation with Coresets:

Explain how to run image segmentation task.py, including the path to the coreset file and any other required arguments.
Refer to the whatsapp vid for a visual demonstration of segmentation using coresets.
## Video Demonstrations

Image Segmentation with Coresets: Watch whatsapp vid to see how coresets are used for image segmentation.
Coreset Construction: The video for coreset construction has been attached to GC).
